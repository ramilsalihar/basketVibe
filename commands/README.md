сдуф# 📚 Commands Folder - Project Documentation

This folder contains all project documentation and coding guidelines for the BasketVibe basketball community app.

## 🧭 How It Works

The documentation system uses a **smart routing approach**:

1. **`CONTEXT_ROUTER.md`** - The main router that intelligently directs to relevant documentation based on task type
2. **Documentation Files** - Specific guides for different aspects of the project

## 📋 Documentation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTEXT_ROUTER.md` | **Start here!** Routes tasks to appropriate documentation |
| `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Main implementation guide and workflow |
| `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` | Project context, tech stack, dependencies |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Clean Architecture patterns and code templates |
| `FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md` | File organization and placement guidelines |
| `DOMAIN_MODELS.md` | Entity definitions and domain logic |
| `UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md` | Design system, colors, typography, UI patterns |
| `FEATURES_AND_RULES.md` | Feature-specific rules and coding standards |

## 🎯 Usage for AI Assistants

When working on a task:

1. **Check `CONTEXT_ROUTER.md`** first to identify relevant documentation
2. **Read the indicated files** based on task type (design, architecture, features, etc.)
3. **Follow the patterns** and guidelines in the documentation
4. **Refer back** to specific files as needed during implementation

## 🔄 Task Type Examples

- **UI/Design Task** → Read `UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- **Architecture Task** → Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`
- **New Feature** → Read `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md` + related files
- **Domain Models** → Read `DOMAIN_MODELS.md`

See `CONTEXT_ROUTER.md` for the complete routing guide.
